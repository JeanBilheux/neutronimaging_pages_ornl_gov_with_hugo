{{%expand "I get a firefox error message when trying to start the jupyter notebooks on the analysis machine." %}}
After double clicking the **start jupyter** icon, I get an **Firefox** error message telling me that I have another
Firefox window opened. 

The short way to fix that is by starting the **Help me** application.

and click the **Fix Firefox**!

This should fix your issue and you should be able to start the jupyter notebooks now.
