Our jupyter python notebooks are very straighforward to use but there are just a few **key points** you need to know.

#### Execute cells

The notebooks must be run from **top** to **bottom**. Place the cursor in the first cell and either click the
<li class='fa fa-step-forward'></li> icon, or by using the keyboard shortcut **SHIFT + ENTER**.

#### Output and widgets

The cell is then executed and depending on the contain of this one, you may see or not an output to the cell.
The output is always displayed just below the cell ran. In some of our notebooks you will see **widgets** that you will
need to interact with. Here are a few examples of widgets you may encounter in your notebook.

In some notebooks, the output may even show up in the back of the notebook (the default cell output will give you a
message that let you know where to look). Those outside widgets are more complex user interface such as the one shown
here.
