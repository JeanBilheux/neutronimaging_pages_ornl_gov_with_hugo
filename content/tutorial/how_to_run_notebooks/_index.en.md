We provide a set of jupyter python notebooks. Those provide many advantages:

  * rapid implementation for your special needs
  * ease of use
  * easy to modify if you need to
  * use of python language (widely used in the scientific world)
  * nothing to install for you as we take care of this for you when you use your analysis computer

To start the jupyter notebook, just **double click** the **Start Jupyter** icon in your desktop and be patient as the
python server starts a firefox browser with the right python environment and move to the rigth folder, for you!
