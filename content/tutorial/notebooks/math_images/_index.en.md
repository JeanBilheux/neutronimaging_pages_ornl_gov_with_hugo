**Notebook name**: math_images.ipynb

## Description

This notebook allows you to perform simple math (**addition** or **subtraction** for now) on a stack of images. 

The current requirement is that you can add or subtract a single image (that you will select) on a stack of images.

### Select the images to operate on

Using the [file selection tool]({{%relref "/tutorial/notebooks/file_selector/_index.md#activate-search" %}}), select 
the images you want use in the math. 

### select the second image to use in the math

Using the [file selection tool]({{%relref "/tutorial/notebooks/file_selector/_index.md#activate-search" %}}), select 
the image you want to use on the other side of the math.

### Math Method

You can currently only select **add** or **subtraction**.

### Recap

The program gives you a recapitulation of the math you are about to perform, such as:
 
 * the number of files affected
 * the math algorithm
 * the name of the second file image

### Select output location

Using the [folder selection tool]({{%relref "/tutorial/notebooks/file_selector/_index.md#activate-search" %}}), select 
the location where you want to create the final images.

Once the files have been created, a message will let you know where you can check the result.
