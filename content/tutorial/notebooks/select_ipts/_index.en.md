## Select your Instrument

Due to the success of the imaging technique ( :-) ), we are not limited to HFIR anymore. That means you will need to 
select your instrument to allow to list the IPTS of this particular beam line.

## Enter IPTS

Use the top text box to specify your IPTS number. As you enter the number, the program check if the IPTS exists or not.
A message will be displayed on the right side informing you if the file exist or not.

If the IPTS can be located, the second widget (list of IPTS) will automatically jump to that folder.

## Select IPTS

The second widget list all the IPTS found for your instrument (Imaging by default). Just select your IPTS.
