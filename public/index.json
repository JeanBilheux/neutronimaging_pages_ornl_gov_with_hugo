Step by Step Select the parent folder Make sure the folder you select contains all the data folders. Any other folder selected (higher or lower in the hierarchy will crash the application)!\nSelect the data folder to correct In the table, simply select all the data folder you want to correct.

The script run in the back requires user input to finish it, because we wanted to allow you to run several job one after the other without your input, we, using the time out value, stop the process manually. During testing, we found that 35s is long enough to allow all the files to be translater. In case you find that the time out shows up too early, you may need to increase the time here.\n"

Select your IPTS Need help using the IPTS selector?\n Select the images to rebin Using the file selection tool, select the images you want to rebin.\nNB: After selection of the images, those will be automatically loaded in memory.\nSelect Bin Parameter It\u0026rsquo;s time to select your bin parameter. The cell will also gives you, for information, the size of your image before and after rebin.\nSelect Output Folder Just one more step. Select where you want those new images to be created. Once selected using the [folder selection tool]((/tutorial/notebooks/file_selector/#activate-search), the images will be automatically rebin and exported. The program will create a folder called after the input folder from where the initial images were retrieved inside the output folder you selected following this convention\n Input folder: my_data Output folder: my_data_rebin_by_2 (or whatever the rebin coefficient you selected)  "

This edge position (vertically and horizontally) is then used to register the images. If you are curious about the algorithm used to define the edge position, we are using the same algorithm as the water intake algorithm called sliding average.\n position the horizontal and vertical profiles on top of high contrast object change size (lenght and width) of profile regions if needed calculate edge (peak position) of marker in all images   select one of the bottom 3 options to export, save registered images.

Images Selected Whenever at least two images are selected (other than reference image), a checkbox labeled all and a slider will show up on the left of the UI.\nBy default all the images selected are display (mean of all images). But if you uncheck the all checkbox, then you can gradually display the imagess from the first one to the last one.\nThis slider will allow to go from the first image selected to the second by increasing the opacity of the first one, and decreasing the opacity of the second one. Once only the second image is display, keep moving the cursor will bring to display the third image and the second image will vanish.\nThe goal of this slider is to gradually display the images one by one.\nThe right slider to display current image vs reference image is always available.\n Export By clicking the Export \u0026hellip; button (bottom right) you will export the images registered into a folder you select.\nAdvanced users All the data registered can be access from the python notebook\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; data_registered = o_registration.data_dict \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; print(np.shape(data_registered['data'])) (8, 2048, 2048)  you can also reach the list of file names and their metadata\n\u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; import pprint \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; pprint.pprint(data_registered['file_name']) ['/Volumes/my_book_thunderbolt_duo/IPTS/IPTS-19921-Charles/02/im0000.tif', '/Volumes/my_book_thunderbolt_duo/IPTS/IPTS-19921-Charles/02/im0031.tif', '/Volumes/my_book_thunderbolt_duo/IPTS/IPTS-19921-Charles/02/im0032.tif', '/Volumes/my_book_thunderbolt_duo/IPTS/IPTS-19921-Charles/02/im0033.tif', '/Volumes/my_book_thunderbolt_duo/IPTS/IPTS-19921-Charles/02/im0034.tif', '/Volumes/my_book_thunderbolt_duo/IPTS/IPTS-19921-Charles/02/im0035.tif', '/Volumes/my_book_thunderbolt_duo/IPTS/IPTS-19921-Charles/02/im0036.tif', '/Volumes/my_book_thunderbolt_duo/IPTS/IPTS-19921-Charles/02/im0037.tif'] \u0026gt;\u0026gt;\u0026gt; pprint.pprint(data_registered['metadata'][0]) {256: 2048, 257: 2048, 258: (16,), 259: 1, 262: 1, 270: 'slope = 2.13626E-05 \\roffset = 0.00000E+00\\r', 273: (8,), 277: 1, 278: 2048, 279: (8388608,), 282: 10.0, 283: 10.0, 296: 3, 320: (0,), 339: (1,)}  "

You can define\n the prefix file name the starting index the index number of digits  Main use of this notebook In this notebook, we will correctly format the file name index of the file selected. This allows the sorting of the file name to works all the time. For example, there are many cases where the images are saved using the following convention\nWrong filename index\nimage_1.tif image_2.tif image_3.tif image_4.tif ... image_10.tif image_11.tif ... image_100.tif  Using this convention, any sorting algorithm will sort them as followed\nWrong sorting\nimage_1.tif image_10.tif image_100.tif ...  So this notebook will fix this issue by renaming the files\ncorrect filename index\nimage_001.tif image_002.tif image_003.tif image_004.tif ... image_010.tif image_011.tif ... image_100.tif  Start the notebook If you need help accessing this notebook, check the How To \u0026gt; Start the python notebooks tutorial.\nHow to Use It? Select your IPTS Check the full tutorial here\nSelect images to rename Using the file dialog tool, select the folder for which you want to renmame the files.\nOnly the most dominant file type (ex: tiff, fits) from the folder will be renamed\nDefine new naming schema Current schema name This is where you define the way the file name is defined. You need to specify what string separates the first part of the file name with the index. The entire part of the string before this separator will be replaced by your own string (defined in New Naming Schema).\nThe Random input dropdown list displays a random selection of the input files, to help you in defining the separator string.\nNew naming schema Here, you define the new prefix file name, index separator, number of digits and offset of this index.\nExample:\n old file name: experiment_0845454_10.tiff separator: _ new file name prefix: my_image number of digits: 4 offset: 15 new file name will be: my_image_0025.tiff  Result The bottom part of the cell will show the result of the naming on the first image selected.\nIf the new name shows an Error, checks your pre index separator.\nOutput folder You simply need to select where the new renamed file will be created. Then the program will copy the selected files and renamed them in the folder you selected.\nFeel free to check the dropdown list that shows the old name versus the new name of each file.\n"

Wait for the progress bar to be done.\nNeed help using the File Selector?\n \nWater Intake Calculator UI Resizing widgets It\u0026rsquo;s possible to resize or move any of the plots.\nSorting Algorithm By default, all the images are sorted using their time stamps. But in some cases (old IPTS), the time stamp may be wrong. So It\u0026rsquo;s possible to:\n either sort them using their name and let you define the time interval between the runs define a folder that contains the .dsc files created by the MCP. Those files contain in all cases, the correct time stamp.   Profile Algorithm You can select the profile algorithm to use (to integrate over the x-axis of the region selected) using the profile algorithms available\n add mean median  The profile is calculated using the following method:\n retrieve the region you defined in the top left image using the profile algorithm you selected, will integrate over the x-axis of the ROI display the profile vs the y-pixels.  Using Pixel or Size Reference By default the water intake profile display the position of the \u0026ldquo;wave\u0026rdquo; as a pixel number vs the time. But it\u0026rsquo;s also possible to display this one using a real dimension (mm). To do so, just click the water intake y_axis -\u0026gt; distance check box and define the dimension of the pixel.\nIntegration Direction In the new version of the application, it is now possible to specify the direction of integration of the profiles. Select either y_axis or x_axis to change this direction.\nWater Intake Algorithms It\u0026rsquo;s possible to chose between 2 different algorithms to calculate the \u0026ldquo;wave\u0026rdquo; front position.\nSliding Average This method is fully demonstrated in this PDF document\nError Function Fitting The signal is fitted using a modified version of the error function as shown here\nChange Point You can now select a 3rd algorithm based on the following python library (changepy)\nRebin For very poor statistics data, you can rebin the data by 2, 3 or more pixels.
