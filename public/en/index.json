Request access to HFIR data\nYou can request access to your data by visiting this page https://neutronsr.us/accounts/request.html TOP \n Step 2. Reach your data If the goal is to bring your data to your computer for local visualization and analysis -not recommended due to the size of the data and the tools we offer via our analysis computer - the easiest way is to use FileZilla.\n1. Install FileZilla.\n2 Create and configure a new bookmark\nEnter the information as followed:\n Host: analysis.sns.gov Port: 22 Protocol: Select SFTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol Logon Type: Normal User: \u0026lt;your xcams\u0026gt; Password: \u0026lt;your password\u0026gt;  Click Connect\nYou can now browse to your data by following the structure /HFIR/CG1D/IPTS-XXXX\nIf you get lost in the file system, here is a typical map of the file structure.\n\n"

Be patient as the python server starts a firefox browser with the right python environment and move to the right folder, for you!\nGetting the browser up and running with the notebooks page display takes around 10 to 20 seconds.\n To start a notebook, just click any of the .ipynb file (normalization.ipynb in this tutorial).\nFirst thing we recommend at this point is to make a copy of this notebook.

This widget will look like this The UI is pretty self explanatory but you just need to know that:\n In the file/folder listing widget\n . means refresh of the current location .. means moving up one directory, or folder.  The file or folder will be really selected only once you have clicked the Select button at the bottom right corner.\n To select more than one file (when this option is available), CLICK first file then SHIFT + CLICK the last one. Or ALT + CLICK to individually select each file.\n  Output and widgets The cell is then executed and depending on the contain of this one, you may see or not an output to the cell. The output is always displayed just below the cell ran. In some of our notebooks you will see widgets that you will need to interact with. Here are a few examples of widgets you may encounter in your notebook.\nIn some notebooks, the output may even show up in the back of the notebook (the default cell output will give you a message that let you know where to look).

The jupyter notebook developed by jupyter are an easy way to run python code using only a browser. By accessing our analysis computer, you won\u0026rsquo;t have anythign to install. Refer to our How To page to learn how to do that.\n    Where are my data and how can I access them?   The following tutorial will show you where are you data and how you can access them. Just go to How To \u0026gt; Access your data\n    I get a firefox error message when trying to start the jupyter notebooks on the analysis machine.   After double clicking the start jupyter icon, I get an Firefox error message telling me that I have another Firefox window opened.\nThe short way to fix that is by starting the Help me application.\nThen go to the Desperate Actions\nand click the Fix Firefox!\nThis should fix your issue and you should be able to start the jupyter notebooks now.\n    Where do I find ImageJ (or Fiji) on the analysis computer?
