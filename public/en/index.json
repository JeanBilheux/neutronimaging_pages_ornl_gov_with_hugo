Create an XCAMS account\nIf you have not done so, please create an XCAMS account 2. Request access to HFIR data\nYou can request access to your data by visiting this page https://neutronsr.us/accounts/request.html TOP \n Step 2. Reach your data If the goal is to bring your data to your computer for local visualization and analysis -not recommended due to the size of the data and the tools we offer via our analysis computer - the easiest way is to use FileZilla.\n1. Install FileZilla.\n2 Create and configure a new bookmark\nEnter the information as followed:\n Host: analysis.sns.gov Port: 22 Protocol: Select SFTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol Logon Type: Normal User: \u0026lt;your xcams\u0026gt; Password: \u0026lt;your password\u0026gt;  Click Connect\nYou can now browse to your data by following the structure /HFIR/CG1D/IPTS-XXXX\n\n"

The output is always displayed just below the cell ran. In some of our notebooks you will see widgets that you will need to interact with. Here are a few examples of widgets you may encounter in your notebook.\nIn some notebooks, the output may even show up in the back of the notebook (the default cell output will give you a message that let you know where to look). Those outside widgets are more complex user interface such as the one shown here.\n\n Modify the notebook "
