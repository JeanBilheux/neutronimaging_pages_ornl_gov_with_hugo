Create an XCAMS account\nIf you have not done so, please create an XCAMS account 2. Request access to HFIR data\nYou can request access to your data by visiting this page https://neutronsr.us/accounts/request.html TOP \n Step 2. Reach your data If the goal is to bring your data to your computer for local visualization and analysis -not recommended due to the size of the data and the tools we offer via our analysis computer - the easiest way is to use FileZilla.\n1. Install FileZilla.\n2 Create and configure a new bookmark\nEnter the information as followed:\n Host: analysis.sns.gov Port: 22 Protocol: Select SFTP - SSH File Transfer Protocol Logon Type: Normal User: \u0026lt;your xcams\u0026gt; Password: \u0026lt;your password\u0026gt;  Click Connect\nYou can now browse to your data by following the structure /HFIR/CG1D/IPTS-XXXX\nIf you get lost in the file system, here is a typical map of the file structure.\n\n"

This widget will look like this The UI is pretty self explanatory but you just need to know that:\n In the file/folder listing widget\n . means refresh of the current location .. means moving up one directory, or folder.  The file or folder will be really selected only once you have clicked the Select button at the bottom right corner.\n To select more than one file (when this option is available), CLICK first file then SHIFT + CLICK the last one. Or ALT + CLICK to individually select each file.\n  Output and widgets The cell is then executed and depending on the contain of this one, you may see or not an output to the cell. The output is always displayed just below the cell ran. In some of our notebooks you will see widgets that you will need to interact with. Here are a few examples of widgets you may encounter in your notebook.\nIn some notebooks, the output may even show up in the back of the notebook (the default cell output will give you a message that let you know where to look). Those outside widgets are more complex user interface such as the one shown here.\n\n Modify the notebook "
